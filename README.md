# 🎂 Birthdays

A sleek birthday reminder app, built with Flutter - designed to help you celebrate friends and family on their special day, taking the guess-work out of remembering their age.

## ✨ Key Features

- View birthdays and the person's age for the current year and next year.
- Set reminders for four weeks, two weeks, and one week before a birthday. A reminder will always be sent on the day.
- Two ways to view birthdays - a list view or a calendar view.
- Effortlessly add, update, and delete birthdays.

## 📱 How It Works

### Reminders

> ⚠️ For reminders to work, the app may require you to allow notifications and allow the app permission to set alarms.
